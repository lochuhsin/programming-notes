## Welcome to My Journey
### Who Am I ?

I am Albert, born in 1995 Asian with tons of passions, dreams, interests and see life as a Journey. I’m deeply in love with technologies, games, travels and ___fashion___.

Whaaaat fashion?😳 Yuuuup that’s me. In my closet, I’ve got this awesome collection of clothes because I absolutely love shopping. But here’s the kicker - I’m actually a professional software engineer. Yeah, I know, it’s kinda weird sometimes cause who’d expect an engineer to be all into fashion? 🤪. 

Another thing about me is that I’m a passionate food enthusiast who also loves to cook. Whether it’s fine dining or street food, I’m always eager to indulge in delicious flavors.

Anyway, I am both a dreamer and a practitioner. I believe life is a journey, meant to be filled with memorable and unique moments.
