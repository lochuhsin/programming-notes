#### Solution 1

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # first we will need to sort the intervals by start
        # min heap to store intervals, compared by end

        # each time an new interal comes, we compare the current interval start
        # with the min heap interval end, to see if we need more conference room
        # if not, pop the min heap until it is either empty or end > start

        # track down the lenth of the mean heap
        # I'm going to use package, the heapq compare the first element
        for interval in intervals:
            interval[0], interval[1] = interval[1], interval[0]

        # intervals now becomes [end, start]

        # sort by start
        sort_interval = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[1])
        heap = [sort_interval[0]]
        max_room = len(heap)
        for interval in sort_interval[1:]:
            
            pre_end, _ = heap[0]
            _, curr_start = interval


            # comment: good thoughts but unable to code it properly
            while curr_start >= pre_end:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
                if not heap:
                    break
                pre_end, _ = heap[0]

            heapq.heappush(heap, interval)

            max_room = max(max_room, len(heap))
        return max_room

```

#### Description:
Comment: good thoughts but unable to code it properly, and edge cases should be more careful.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Space Complexity: O(n)


#### Solution 2
