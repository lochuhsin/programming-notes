#### Solution 1 (Straight forward but TLE) my solution

```go
func findMinHeightTrees(n int, edges [][]int) []int {
    nodeHeighArr := []int{}
    edgeDict := map[int]map[int]bool{}
    for _, edge := range edges{
        n1, n2 := edge[0], edge[1]
        if _, ok := edgeDict[n1]; !ok{
            edgeDict[n1] = map[int]bool{n2: true}
        }
        if _, ok := edgeDict[n2]; !ok{
            edgeDict[n2] = map[int]bool{n1: true}
        }
        edgeDict[n1][n2], edgeDict[n2][n1] = true, true
    }

    minH := 200000
    for i := 0; i < n; i++{
        seen := map[int]bool{}
        h := dfs(i, &edgeDict, &seen)
        minH = min(minH, h)
        nodeHeighArr = append(nodeHeighArr, h)
    }

    results := []int{}
    for i, val := range nodeHeighArr{
        if val == minH{
            results = append(results, i)
        }
    }
    return results
}
// returning max height
func dfs(node int, edgeDict *map[int]map[int]bool, seen *map[int]bool) int {
    if (*seen)[node]{
        return -1
    }
    (*seen)[node] = true

    nextNodes := (*edgeDict)[node]
    maxH := -1
    for nNode, _ := range nextNodes{
        h := dfs(nNode, edgeDict, seen)
        maxH = max(maxH, h)
    }
    return maxH+1
}

func max(a, b int) int{
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func min(a, b int) int{
    if a < b{
        return a
    }
    return b
}



```

#### Description:
Loop each of nodes with dfs to find which one gets the minimum.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(N)


#### Solution 2 (Brilliant)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if n <= 2:
            return [i for i in range(n)]
        
        #Adjacency list preparation
        neighbors = [set() for i in range(n)]
        for start, end in edges:
            neighbors[start].add(end)
            neighbors[end].add(start)
        
        [#leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree) at layer 0
        leaves = []
        for i in range(n):
            if len(neighbors[i]) == 1:
                leaves.append(i)
        
        #Peel out leaves
        while True:
            new_leaves = []
            
            for leaf in leaves:
                for neighbor in neighbors[leaf]:
                    neighbors[neighbor].remove(leaf)
                    if len(neighbors[neighbor]) == 1:
                        new_leaves.append(neighbor)
                
            if len(new_leaves) == 0:  
                return leaves
            leaves = new_leaves

``` 

Should be rewrite to go

```go

```

#### Solution 3 (Brilliant)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

        # edge cases
        if n <= 2:
            return [i for i in range(n)]

        # Build the graph with the adjacency list
        neighbors = [set() for i in range(n)]
        for start, end in edges:
            neighbors[start].add(end)
            neighbors[end].add(start)

        # Initialize the first layer of leaves
        leaves = []
        for i in range(n):
            if len(neighbors[i]) == 1:
                leaves.append(i)

        # Trim the leaves until reaching the centroids
        remaining_nodes = n
        while remaining_nodes > 2:
            remaining_nodes -= len(leaves)
            new_leaves = []
            # remove the current leaves along with the edges
            while leaves:
                leaf = leaves.pop()
                # the only neighbor left for the leaf node
                neighbor = neighbors[leaf].pop()
                # remove the only edge left
                neighbors[neighbor].remove(leaf)
                if len(neighbors[neighbor]) == 1:
                    new_leaves.append(neighbor)

            # prepare for the next round
            leaves = new_leaves

        # The remaining nodes are the centroids of the graph
        return leaves
``` 

Should be rewrite to go

```go
