#### Solution 1 (mine) [[Queue]] + [[Set]](for look up)

```go
func lengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
    set := make(map[rune]bool)
    queue := make([]rune, 0)
    maxSubstring := 0
    
    for _, r := range s{
        if _, ok := set[r]; !ok{
            set[r] = true
            queue = append(queue, r)
        } else{
            maxSubstring = max(maxSubstring, len(queue))
            for len(queue) > 0{
                val := queue[0]
                queue = queue[1:]
                delete(set, val)

                if val == r{
                    break
                }
            }
            queue = append(queue, r)
            set[r] = true
        }
    }

    return max(maxSubstring, len(queue))
}

func max(a, b int) int{
    if a > b{
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

#### Description:
This one exams the carefullness, very important

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)


#### Solution 2  (TODO : Using two pointers)

```go

```

#### Description:
Since we don't care the elements in the [[Queue]], we could use a pointer to represent the position of the queue. Then we just need to update the head of the pointer to new position.
