### My Approach

```go

```

#### Description
Since the entire array is sorted. we could use binary search to find the index that we need to insert. The first binary search find the newInterval[0], the second finds the newInterval[1]. the index between these two are all overlaps. The last thing is determind if the index itself is overlapped or not.
 

Time Complexity :: possibly O(logN), in general O(N)
Space Complexity ::O(N)


### Second Approach

```go
func insert(intervals [][]int, newInterval []int) [][]int {

	var l [][]int
	var r [][]int
	
	for _, interval := range intervals {

		if interval[1] < newInterval[0] {
			l = append(l, interval)

		} else if interval[0] > newInterval[1] {
			r = append(r, interval)

		} else {
			newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], interval[0])
			newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], interval[1])
		}

	}

	return append(append(l, []int{newInterval[0] ,newInterval[1]}),r...)
}

func min(a, b int) int {
	
	if a < b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}

  

func max(a, b int) int {
	if a > b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}
```

#### Description:
Scan over the entire array, compare the interval with
each head element, find the place where the new interval should place by two conditions.
