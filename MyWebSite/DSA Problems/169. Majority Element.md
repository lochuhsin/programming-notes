 Easy solution:  
O(n) space, O(n) time

```go
    elementMap := make(map[int]int, len(nums) / 2 + 1)
    
    for _, val := range nums{
        elementMap[val] += 1
        
        if v, _ := elementMap[val]; v > (len(nums) / 2){
            return val
        }
    }
    return -1
```

## Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (Optimal)

O(1) space, O(n) time

The key point is, don’t care about memorizing every element. What we actually want is, if the candidate is the final guy, assuming all others are -1, candidate is +1, than after summing up the array, the value will be positive.

To determind which one is the candidate,

lets say : [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

In this case, 1 is obviously the candidate, why ?  
because if we set 1 is candidate, other values which doesn’t equal to 1 is -1, than  
we get the positive number

what if : [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]

This case 2 will be the fake candidate, so we need to determind a way to switch candidate,  
that is while the count is zero,

As u can see, [2 2 2 1 1 1]  |  [1] , the previous sum up will be zero

Therefore there could be a conclusion, if the candidate is fake, at some point , the count will be zero, since the true candidate has number that is lasger than n/2.

Third example:  
[5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

fake candidate start by 1, switch to 2 and 1 …eg  
when we encounter 5 for the first time, it will be replace by 6  
in the end it will come back to 5 .

Actually the above example could reduce to :  
[5, 1, 5, 2, 5]

```go
func majorityElement(nums []int) int {
    
    count := 0
    var candidate int
    
    for _, val := range nums{
        if count == 0{
            candidate = val
        }
        
        if val == candidate{
            count += 1
        } else{
            count -= 1
        }
    }
    return candidate
}
```
