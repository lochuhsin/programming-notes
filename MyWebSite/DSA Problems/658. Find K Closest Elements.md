#### Solution 1 (BinarySearch + Sliding window)

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        # Base case
        if len(arr) == k:
            return arr
        
        # Find the closest element and initialize two pointers
        left = bisect_left(arr, x) - 1
        right = left + 1

        # While the window size is less than k
        while right - left - 1 < k:
            # Be careful to not go out of bounds
            if left == -1:
                right += 1
                continue
            
            # Expand the window towards the side with the closer number
            # Be careful to not go out of bounds with the pointers
            if right == len(arr) or abs(arr[left] - x) <= abs(arr[right] - x):
                left -= 1
            else:
                right += 1
        
        # Return the window
        return arr[left + 1:right]
```

#### Solution 2 (Optimized Binary Search)

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize binary search bounds
        left = 0
        right = len(arr) - k
        
        # Binary search against the criteria described
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if x - arr[mid] > arr[mid + k] - x:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        return arr[left:left + k]

```

#### Description:

The key point is, realize that:
1. using fixed size window to think.
	- the lower bound of window (one could use upper bound instead. Its same)
2. using modified binary search
	- As the binary search becomes: left = 0, right = len(arr) - k
	why ? since if we need k element(at least), the upper bound should be len(arr) - k. (We are assuming left index is the starting point of the sliding window).
