#### Solution 1 (Pair values)

```go
type Pair struct{
    Min int
    Val int
}   

type MinStack struct {
    Stack []Pair
    
}


func Constructor() MinStack {
    return MinStack{Stack: make([]Pair, 0)}
}


func (this *MinStack) Push(val int)  {
    if len(this.Stack) == 0{
        this.Stack = append(this.Stack, Pair{
            Min: val,
            Val: val,
        })
    }else{
        peek := this.Stack[len(this.Stack)-1]
        preMin := peek.Min

        if val <= preMin{
            this.Stack = append(this.Stack, Pair{Min: val, Val: val})
        }else{
            this.Stack = append(this.Stack, Pair{
                Min: preMin,
                Val: val,
            })
        }
    }
}


func (this *MinStack) Pop() {
    if len(this.Stack) > 0{
        this.Stack = this.Stack[:len(this.Stack)-1]
    }
}


func (this *MinStack) Top() int {
    if len(this.Stack) < 0{
        panic("abcde")
    }
    val := this.Stack[len(this.Stack)-1].Val
    return val
}


func (this *MinStack) GetMin() int {
    if len(this.Stack) <= 0{
        return 0
    }
    return this.Stack[len(this.Stack)-1].Min
}
```

#### Description:
While approaching this kind of problems, especially stack, or queue problem. Think of invariants.

In this problem, the invariant is once the numbers were pushed into the stack, the order or the value won't change, unless the value is poped out.

Therefore if previous minimum is determind, there are only two options that will modify this number. 
1. The input number is smaller than previous minimum
2. The minium is poped out.

Now the question rised, is there any way we could store the order of minimum value, with the exact order of the stack ?

Actually, stack can be used to store pairs too. Why don't we store them together?

The above two pictures show the way how it works.
If a new value that is smaller than the current minmum, than the tuple becomes [newMin, newMin]
else:
[newVal, currentMin]

However this solution has its downside, too much duplicate values. So how do we optimize it?

Time Complexity: O(1) for each operation
Space Complexity: O(2N) -> O(N)


#### Solution 2 (2 Stack)

```go

```

#### Description:
This solution tries to improve the space complexity, actually, i could have came up this solution though, if i stick a little bit longer.

First stack stores the original val,
Second stack stores the min order value.

The implementation logic is 80% similar to above solution, but in only one point to noticed.

![[Pasted image 20221219094937.png]]

The min stack should store duplicate minimum values whlie same min value occurs several times. Since once the minimum value is poped out, the value is no longer there.
e.g:

original : 3, 2, 1, 2, 1
minstack: 3, 2, 1

if we don't store the duplicate 1's, once one is poped, this will cause error.

Time Complexity: O(1) for each operation
Space Complexity: O(2N) -> O(N)


#### Solution 3 (2 Stack with num count (tuple))

```go

```

#### Description:
This solution optimize the above two stack with duplicate min values by using  tuple.

Space Complexity: O(2N) -> O(N) (worst case is 2N if no duplicates occur)
