#### Solution 1 (Heap)

```python

```

#### Description:

In go, must implement the comparison function to include both word compare and frequency compare.
Frequency first, lexicographic order second.


Time Complexity: O(klogN)
Space Complexity:


#### Solution 2 (Bucket Sort + Trie)

```go



```

#### Description:

1. First using a map to count all the frequency
2. Using bucket sort (An array of trie)
3. the trie is used to store words with duplcates
4. If we loop trie using preorder, we will get the lexicographic order of words.


Time Complexity: O(n) with large constant in the front
Space Complexity:
