#### Solution 1

```go
func canCompleteCircuit(gas []int, cost []int) int {
    simpArr := make([]int, len(gas))
    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(gas); i++{
        simpArr[i] = gas[i] - cost[i]
        sum += gas[i] - cost[i]
    }
    if sum < 0{
        return -1
    }

    minTankIndex := 0
    minTankValue := 100000
    tank := 0
    for i, sim := range simpArr{
        tank += sim
        if tank <= minTankValue{
            minTankValue = tank
            minTankIndex = i
        }
    }

    return (minTankIndex+1) % len(gas)
}
```

#### Description:
Considering at each index if the gas > cost, means we are gaining some extra gas, otherwise we are losing some gas.

If the starting point exists, it must start from the position where we lose the most of the gas, so that it can start to gain gas first to gather all the gas we need before we start losing.

Take an example like (here the number refers to the value gas[i] - cost[i])

[3,4,-12,4,-5,6]

The minimum tank value will happen at index 4, where the value is -5, because at there our tank is at the minimum value -6, which means if the result exists, it must start to gather gas at index 5 so that we can cover all the gas loss before we reach index 4.

The algorithm is simple, find the minimum tank value and its index, and then use the next index as the starting point.
