### Optimal Solution
```
func isPalindrome(x int) bool {
    
    if x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0){
        return false
    }
    
    revertNum := 0
    
    // only walk half
    for x > revertNum{
        revertNum = revertNum*10 + x % 10
        x /= 10
    }
    
    return x == revertNum || x == revertNum/10
}
```

#### Description
Without using string multiplication, we can instead use math to build number by dividing 10.
The key point here is, we actually only go through half of the number. And we ignore the middle number.

As the above top, is the boundary case, for number that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9x, we make sure they are all false.

Time Complexity:: log10N
Space Complexity:: O(1)
