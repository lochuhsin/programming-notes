#### Solution 1 (BackTracking, not optimal but fundmental)

```go
func canFinish(numCourses int, prerequisites [][]int) bool {
    courseMap := make(map[int][]int)

    for _, relation := range prerequisites{
        curr, prev := relation[0], relation[1]
        if _, ok := courseMap[prev]; ok{
            courseMap[prev] = append(courseMap[prev], curr)
        }else{
            courseMap[prev] = []int{curr}
        }
    }

    path := make([]bool, numCourses)
    
    for i := 0; i < numCourses; i++{
        if isCycle(i, courseMap, &path){
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

func isCycle(curr int, courseMap map[int][]int, path *[]bool) bool{

    arr := *path
    if arr[curr] == true{
        return true
    }

    // mark current node as visited
    arr[curr] = true

    childs := courseMap[curr]
    for _, child := range childs{
        if isCycle(child, courseMap, path){
            return true
        }
    }

    arr[curr] = false
    return false

}
```

#### Description:
Basically, this is a cyclic detection problem.
First of all, building map of a graph is just convenient for further algorithm as node is the key, and with childs list.

The key point is backtracking. Consider the following example:

1 -> 2 -> 3  
Obviously there is no cycle. How do we make sure of that?

We could create a node list or hashmap or whatever that could store with key is node, value is boolean that shows we either visited or not. In this case we choose array.

After going down each recursive, we mark the node as visited. Know, we could check with the array that do we visited this node before or not.

However there is one problem...
Consider this:
1 -> 2 -> 3
2 -> 4 -> 3

This is not a cycle, but we visit node3 twice. How do we avoid this?
Start from here is the backtracking core:

We need to decide whether we should "do something" to the array before returning to the previous node. 

The anwser is yes, we convert current node to unvisit (false) before returning back. This indicates each path is independent. We could access the same node from different path but not in the same path.


Time Complexity: O(E + V^2)
Space Complexity:O(E + V)


#### Solution 2 (Backtracking + memorization)

```go
func canFinish(numCourses int, prerequisites [][]int) bool {
    courseMap := make(map[int][]int)

    for _, relation := range prerequisites{
        curr, prev := relation[0], relation[1]
        if _, ok := courseMap[prev]; ok{
            courseMap[prev] = append(courseMap[prev], curr)
        }else{
            courseMap[prev] = []int{curr}
        }
    }

    path := make([]bool, numCourses)
    visited := make([]bool, numCourses)
    for i := 0; i < numCourses; i++{
        if isCycle(i, courseMap, &path, &visited){
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

func isCycle(curr int, courseMap map[int][]int, path *[]bool, visited *[]bool) bool{

    arr, v := *path, *visited
    if v[curr] == true{
        return false
    }

    if arr[curr] == true{
        return true
    }

    // mark current node as visited
    arr[curr] = true

    childs := courseMap[curr]
    for _, child := range childs{
        if isCycle(child, courseMap, path, visited){
            return true
        }
    }

    arr[curr] = false
    v[curr] = true
    return false

}
```

#### Description:
There is something that could be optimized in solution one. The key is, we revisit the same node multiple times. And we don't need to traverse the same node again if we validate before. 

Therefore, we could create another array, or hashmap ...etc. To store the nodes thats we have seen before with O(1) look up time.

Than we could add a condition to that is( if we have visited this node before, and the node is fine , return to previous node.)

Time Complexity:O(E+V)
Space Complexity:O(E+V)

#### Solution 3 ([[Topological Sort]])
```go

```
