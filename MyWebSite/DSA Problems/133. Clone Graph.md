#### Solution 1 ([[Breadth-first Search|BFS]])

```go
func cloneGraph(node *Node) *Node {
    if node == nil { return nil }
    queue := []*Node{ node } 
    visited, newNode := make(map[int]*Node), &Node{ node.Val, nil }
    visited[node.Val] = newNode
    for len(queue) > 0 {
        pop := queue[0]
        queue = queue[1:]
        for _, v := range pop.Neighbors {
            if _, ok := visited[v.Val]; !ok {
                visited[v.Val] = &Node{ v.Val, nil }
                queue = append(queue, v)
            }
            visited[pop.Val].Neighbors = append(visited[pop.Val].Neighbors, visited[v.Val])
        }
    }
    return newNode
}

```

#### Description:
The keypoint is using visited map to store clone nodes, then we could always go back to the new node and add neighbors while traveraling orignal graph.

Second, since for loop isn't looping the queue directly, queue could append nodes on the fly, instead of creating a new level queue to store current level nodes and switch it.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
