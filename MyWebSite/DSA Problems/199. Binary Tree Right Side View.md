#### Solution 1

```go
func rightSideView(root *TreeNode) []int {
    if root == nil {
        return []int{}
    }
    levelMap := []int{}
    preOrder(root, &levelMap, 0)
    return levelMap
}

func preOrder(root *TreeNode, level *[]int, currentLevel int){
    if root == nil{
        return 
    }
    
    if currentLevel >= len(*level){
        *level = append(*level, root.Val)
    }

    preOrder(root.Right, level, currentLevel+1)
    preOrder(root.Left, level, currentLevel+1)
}


```

#### Description:

This is an optimized form. The most intuitive way is using a map to store an array of each level element. We use pre-order to make sure every element we store is either left to right or right to left. (Depends on travel from right or left). 

1. Now a deeper look, the level of the tree must be contiuous, and at each level we only need to store one element. Therefore we don't a max depth to track down how far we get, we don't need a map to store arrays as value. we could use simple arr as index is the depth.




Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N) recursive call stack + O(logN) -> additional array of max depth


#### Solution 2

```
