#### Solution 1 (Array one pass)

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func removeNthFromEnd(head *ListNode, n int) *ListNode {
    arr := make([]*ListNode, 0)

    current := head
    for current != nil{
        arr = append(arr, current)
        current = current.Next
    }
    if len(arr) == 1{
        return nil
    }
    if len(arr) - n  == 0{
        return arr[1]
    }
    arr[len(arr)-n-1].Next = arr[len(arr)-n].Next
    return arr[0]

}
```

#### Description:
Using array one pass but O(n) memory.

Time Complexity:
Space Complexity:


#### Solution 2 (one pass O(1) space)

```go

```

#### Description:
Using two pointer, the first pointer move n steps first.
Then maintain the interval between first and second ptr while looping first pointer to the end. Now second pointer is the node that needs to be removed.

Time Complexity:
