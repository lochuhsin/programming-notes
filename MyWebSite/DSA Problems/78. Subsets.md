#### Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        sub = [[]]
        for val in nums:
            sub += [curr + [val] for curr in sub]
        return sub


```

#### Description:
Generating none duplicate subsets (like combination).
e.g [1, 2, 3]
([], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3])

Concept:
init -> [[]]
adding 1 -> ([], [1])
adding 2 -> ([], [1], [2], [1, 2]) add element 2 two all previous subset and append to the list

Time Complexity: N * 2^N

#### Solution 2 (BitMask)

```go

```
