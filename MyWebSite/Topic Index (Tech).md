## Description
---

I believe knowledges are linked as graph, just like network instead of tree structure. Therefore all notes under Software Engineer Vault are flatten and linked as Card Link attribute.

Each note is designed to be simple and small, which hopefully only contains core concepts. In this sense, knowledge  
is more easily to breakdown to small pieces and connect to others.

However sometimes it is useful for accessing graph though some roots. Therefore the following list  
contains some of the bigger topics for search convenience.
