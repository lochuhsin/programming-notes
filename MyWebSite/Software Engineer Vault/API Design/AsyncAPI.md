# Description

Async API is a rule of both restricting and organizing APIs. It's a way of extending the rules from [[OpenAPI]]  
to asynchronous version. Such as WebSocket, Channels â€¦ Etc, and other types of protocols such as Kafka, MQTT.  
Since AsyncAPI is inherent from OpenAPI, it supports HTTP based protocol as well.
