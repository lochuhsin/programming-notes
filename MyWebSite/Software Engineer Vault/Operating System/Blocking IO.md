## Description

How data actually comes in from socket to frameworks like converting to HTTP ?

In general, there are 4 steps:

1. Create socket by protocols
2. bind and listen the socket endpoint
3. accept the incoming protocol handshake (TCP uses [[Three Way Handshake]])
4. read, get the incoming data

```python
# this is just a pesudo code, in python we rarely use input array as buffer than output the referenced array.

# 1. this creates a socket endpoint fd, either choose TCP or UDP
listenfd = socket()

# 2. bind and listen
bind(listenfd)
listen(listenfd)
while True:
	
	# 3. Protocol handshake 
	connfd = accept(listenfd)
	while True:

		# 4. Read the input data
		buffer = []int{}
		int n = read(connfd, buffer)
		foo(buffer)
	
		if n < len(buffer): # this is the end of the data
			break
	close(connfd)
```

The main problem of the above code contains 4 system calls:

1. bind
2. listen
3. accept
4. read

System calls is a blocking operation. Therefore we need to avoid or somehow get a way with it.

Bind and listen is unavoidable and only on startup so it's ok to leave it.  
Accept is inevitable either since it is a handshake when connection comes in.

So there is the last choice, that is read(). Especially it's in the loop, where the main system calls and costs usually lies in.

The above three motion demonstrates the flow when a connection from the internet comes in. This is called Blocking I/O.
