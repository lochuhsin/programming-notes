## Description
---

Clock Synchronization is a timestamp sync problem that occurs in different machines, appears commonly in distributed systems.  
There are several algorithms to make sure the system clock is sync in certain conditions.

- [[Network Time Protocol]] (Most common)
- [[Berkeley Algorithm]]
- [[Vector Clocks]]
- [[Lamport Timestamps]]
