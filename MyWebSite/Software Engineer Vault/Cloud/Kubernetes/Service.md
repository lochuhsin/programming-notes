## Description
---

Service is a resource type that manages connections between resources such as pods, replica sets, nodes, cluster, and user endpoints.

Note: Service is, in fact, just like a virtual server inside the node (or cluster), it has its own IP (Called cluster IP of the service). 

There are three types of services:

1. [[NodePort]]
2. [[ClusterIP]]
3. [[LoadBalancer]]
