## Description
---

UDP connection protocol is an unreliable connection between two service.

### Characteristics:
- Connectionless, meaning that UDP protocol is only responsible for sending data, there are no connection concept, just data (packets). There are no handshakes in UDP, unlike TCP uses three-way handshake.
- Since it is connectionless, the packet is not guaranteed to send successfully.
- The performance of UDP is relatively high, since there are no handshakes, guaranteed the packet order â€¦etc.
