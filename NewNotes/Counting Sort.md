## Description
---

Counting sort is an unstable and high speed sorting algorithm. Very easy to implement with O(n) time complexity and O(m) space complexity, m is the range of integers.

Downsides:  
In general, it's an unstable algorithm, and it only fits to known range integer arrays or anything that could be mapped to known range integer.

### Concept:

Create an array for memorizing the count of each integer.  
For example, if the range of input array's integer is 0â€“10 than we create an array of the size 11. Each index represents the count of element.
